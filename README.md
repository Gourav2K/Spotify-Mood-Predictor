# Spotify-Mood-Predictor

## To use the music streaming history of a Spotify user to predict the user’s emotion and mood.

- Instead of taking individual songs from a user’s history and analyzing moods of the songs in a discrete manner…
- We are attempting to map our prediction of a user’s mood changes by analyzing their streaming history as a continuous dataset.
- We believe this is a more effective way of understanding emotional changes induced into users through their streaming history.

## Key Research Insights
1. Lyrics vs Audio Classification: A combination of audio features and lyrics provide a more robust model. 
2. Emotional Models: There are two dominant emotional models in the music-mood classification space: valence-arousal and GEMS. 
3. Perceived vs Induced Emotion: The ultimate goal of a model is not to label a song according to mood, but predict how a song invokes a particular emotion in the user. 

## The Approach:
