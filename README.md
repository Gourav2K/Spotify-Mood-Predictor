# Spotify-Mood-Predictor

## To use the music streaming history of a Spotify user to predict the user’s emotion and mood.

- Instead of taking individual songs from a user’s history and analyzing moods of the songs in a discrete manner…
- We are attempting to map our prediction of a user’s mood changes by analyzing their streaming history as a continuous dataset.
- We believe this is a more effective way of understanding emotional changes induced into users through their streaming history.
